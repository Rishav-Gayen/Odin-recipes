    <h2>How to make a flourless chocolate cake</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>18 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>6 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees
        C). Grease a 10-inch round cake pan; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine sugar, water, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat.
        Stir until completely dissolved; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals,
        stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour the chocolate into
        the bowl of an electric mixer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the butter into the chocolate, one piece at a time, until combined.
        Beat in the hot sugar water. Slowly beat in the eggs, one at a time.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Let the cake cool completely before frosting.</li>
      <li>
        Turn the cake out onto a cooling rack. Frost the cooled cake with the
        frosting, then serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
